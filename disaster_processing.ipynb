       "\"First of all, I want to say that I have huge respect for both of them. They are both amazing champions of our sport. One a little bit more of champion than another, but still... When I was playing junior Grand Slams, it was, like, a classic semifinal, Djokovic, Wawrinka, I remember two times in Australia, I think, and final of Roland Garros. It was all when I was a junior. Some amazing tennis from both of them, like, out of this world. I will probably watch the match and enjoy it. Talking about them differently, I mean, playing Novak is always tough, and especially five-setters. At this moment we played two times out of five sets. I lost both of them. Our games are really physical. Even he said it. It's not going to be easy. Or if Stan wins, I played him in Wimbledon. I think that was our only meeting. Totally different. Grass, I was young, I was less experienced, so I was on fire that match. I think that Stan also in Grand Slams, he's playing right now better than on other tournaments. Let's first see the winner.\""
